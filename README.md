#project.bootstrapping-your-first-Idea

Welcome!

You can find the link to the website [here](https://robinwesterback.github.io/bootstrap-4-test/)

The website is made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

To create the website I followed instructions given in the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course. 

I also completed the challenge and styled it in a fitting manner.

Thank you for reading!
